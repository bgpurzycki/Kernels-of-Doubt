# Kernels-of-Doubt

There are many hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to the rejection of
religious commitments. However, the bulk of current studies assessing these predictions are
limited insofar as they primarily sample from state-level societies rather than from small-scale
societies. Additionally, despite the long-standing appreciation that many traditions emphasize
different components of religious devotion, studies typically focus on ideational commitment or
belief (doxa) while ignoring practical or behavioral expression (praxis). How persistent and
cross-culturally widespread is the rejection of religion? How do people express this rejection? Is
this rejection consistent across traditions within societies? This project seeks to detail the
frequency and form of religious non-commitment by utilizing a large cross-cultural data set with
sub-samples ranging from foragers and horticulturalists to herders and the fully market-
integrated.
